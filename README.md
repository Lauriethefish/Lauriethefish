Hi, I'm an amateur developer who loves programming.

## Learning to code
I learnt to code by myself, mostly through Scratch and then later Python. After some time, I started to learn C#, and later Java, with the goal of making Minecraft Bukkit plugins.
This went well, and a few months later I had created a minigame (admittedly a terribly coded one) for a few friends.

#### C++
A while later, I got bored of making plugins and tried my hand at C++ development. I was very confused at first at how weirdly the language worked, but I soon understood
memory management and how it wasn't done for me anymore. My main reason for learning C++ was to make OpenGL applications, although I didn't end up doing much of this in the end.

#### BetterPortals
After this, I returned to plugin development. I had an idea for a plugin that let you see through portals, and created it over the course of about a week. This is [BetterPortals](https://github.com/Lauriethefish/BetterPortals). This was the first time I published my code to github.

The code was much better than what I had created before, and was commented well so that I would be able to understand it later on. The project gained some traction, and has now risen to over 20,000 downloads.

#### Beat Saber Modding
In the meanwhile, I was starting to get into playing the game [Beat Saber](https://beatsaber.com/) on the Oculus Quest. I was having a lot of fun playing custom levels, and after a while I thought I would try to create my own mods. This took a while for me to learn, mostly due to the lack of documentation and, at the time, confusing setup. But eventually I figured it out and created a few mods.

#### QuestPatcher

In the early days of Gorilla Tag modding, I make a small tool for modding il2cpp applications on the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2. This is [QuestPatcher](https://github.com/Lauriethefish/QuestPatcher). It has now reached over 100,000 downloads. 

The QMOD format used in QuestPatcher was later adopted by [BMBF](https://bmbf.dev/), the primary modding tool for Beat Saber on the quest.
